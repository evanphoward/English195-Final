                    <p>As we explore the effects of climate change on marginalized communities in your selected country, it's crucial to understand the past trends and patterns that have shaped their current reality. In this section, we present a grid of graphs that showcase key climate change indicators curated by the World Bank for each country. Please click on a graph to expand it and click again to minimize.</p>
                    <p>These indicators provide an overview of the changing landscape in areas such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use, access to resources, and population growth. By examining the historical data, we can better comprehend the challenges these communities have faced and identify the factors that have contributed to their vulnerability.</p>
                    <p>Take a moment to explore the graphs and discover how each indicator has evolved over time in your selected country. Pay attention to the trends and fluctuations that may either be caused by climate change, or be excacerbated by climate change.</p>
                    <p>But these indicators don't tell the whole story, not one bit. These are very specific metrics, curated by one specific organization. They don't tell the whole story, and remove the human and personal element that is intrinsic to climate justice.</p>

                    <p>Somalia's climate is influenced by factors such as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, monsoonal winds, ocean currents, and the El Niño Southern Oscillation. The country is generally arid and semi-arid, with two seasonal rainfall seasons, the Gu (April to June) and the Deyr (October to November). Annual mean temperatures hover around 30°C, and precipitation is generally low and highly variable. The climate ranges from arid desert in the northeastern and central regions to semiarid steppe in the south and northwest, with some areas experiencing tropical savanna or cold steppe climates.</p>
                    <p>Temperatures in Somalia can reach extremes, especially in the north, where they can surpass 45°C in July and drop below freezing in December. Rainfall is also highly variable, with some regions receiving less than 100 mm annually and others up to 610 mm. The coastal areas are hot and humid, while inland regions are typically dry and hot. Four main seasons revolve around shifts in wind patterns, affecting pastoral and agricultural life: Jilal (harshest dry season, December to March), Gu (main rainy season, April to June), Xagaa (second dry season, July to September), and Dayr (shortest rainy season, October to December).</p>
                    <p>The unique culture, traditions, and practices of the Somali people are deeply rooted in the climate of Somalia, but this unique climate is poised to be drastically affected by climate change, while the government of Somalia lacks the stability and resources to properly address the effects of climate change.</p>

                    <p>In this visualization, you can select a year between 1900 and 2013 and see how the yearly average temperature has fluctuated over time.</p>
                    <p>Note that the scale goes from about 60 degrees to 90 degrees, so we've exagerated the scale slightly to see the change in temperature over this time period.</p>
                    <p>For all three countries, the change in temperature over the last one hundred years is clear and present, and has moved in lockstep with the climate change indicators that we examined earlier.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>I hope this dive into the effects and implications on a particular country, especially one which has been marginalized and does not have the resources of more developed nations to combat the effects of climate change, has encouraged you to continue doing research into the effects of climate change on marginalized communities and nations, and think deeper on the uneven ways in which climate change will affect our planet.</p>
